## ✨ Description

This project demonstrates a **simple queue implementation** in Java using an array. It includes **basic queue operations** such as:

- Enqueue (Insert)
- Dequeue (Delete)
- Display (View all queue elements)

The program is **menu-driven** and user-friendly, making it ideal for students learning Data Structures and Algorithms.
